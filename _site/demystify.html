        <h1>LETTER FROM ALAN</h1>
        
        Hi family and friends,
        
        <p>I wanted to shoot out this email regarding preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic. One thing I‚Äôve learned through my work in a national security laboratory is that our country is pretty fragile against extreme events. Whether it be a targeted attack against our electrical infrastructure or a pandemic, the ability for our society to respond is constrained by physics and decision making. With this outlook and an assessment of the news, I wanted to tell everyone that I see no reason to be optimistic about this scenario: Our country is not prepared for this crisis.</p>
        <p>I am concerned that this pandemic will enter into a crisis within the next 5-10 days, if not sooner equivalent to what Italy is experiencing now. If you haven‚Äôt been following the news, Italy has closed all non-essential commerce (presumably non-grocery stores and pharmacies) and restricted travel within the country to reduce the Novel Coronavirus‚Äô spread. The United States is not prepared for the estimated 70-150 million people that are predicted to become infected with this virus. As Rachael Maddow just pointed out, that implies 5-30 million hospitalizations. If all of this occurs at once, it‚Äôll overwhelm our health system and the mortality rate will skyrocket. As many as half a million people or more could die from this virus.</p>
        <p>Because of this potentially catastrophic situation, extreme social separation measures could be enacted to stem the spread of the infection (i.e. "flatten the curve‚Äù). These measures might include travel bans, activity cancelations, closures of non-essential services (i.e. not groceries, utilities, pharmacies, etc.) for as long as 4-8+ weeks. This might include the loss of the post-office for a period of time.</p>
        <p>I recommend preparing for this event sooner rather than later (i.e. tomorrow morning). The sooner you are prepare the easier it will be to do so.</p>
        
        <p>Plan on spending 2-4 weeks at home without leaving your domicile. Ensure you have:
            <ul>
                <li>Food</li>
                <li>Medicine (including flu medicine to treat yourself if you become infected)</li>
                <li>Sanitation materials</li>
                <li>Toiletries (e.g. toothpaste, toilet paper)</li>
                <li>Entertainment</li>
                <li>Ensure your car is full of gas</li>
                
                <li>Minimize how often you leave your house</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>At the worst of it, as many as 1 in 100 or more people might become infected at a time, potentially leaving virus on many surfaces in public. Given that, try as hard as you physically can to not get infected (don‚Äôt meet large groups). If you do, you risk increasing the mortality of this disease for others. </p>
        <p>You‚Äôll still get utilities, so don‚Äôt worry about that: leave the generators & water at the store</p>
        <p>Don‚Äôt become complacent: Anyone can get this virus. Tom Hanks and US Senatorial aides have already started testing positive for this virus. Additionally, it has already began spreading through government bodies (i.e. amongst bureaucrats, technocrats, & politicians) in other countries. </p>
        
        <p>Just as it was plastered around the country during World War II, "Ration and Support the War Effort‚Äù can be a mantra of the present war against infectious disease. It‚Äôs essential that we all do our part to support our community and society against this significant threat. Keep your hands clean away from your face. </p>
        
        <p>I hope everyone is doing well and is able to prepare for this notable moment in history. </p>
        
        <p>Stay healthy, happy, and comfortable. </p>
        
        <p>Best of love,</p>
        <p>Alan Smith</p>
